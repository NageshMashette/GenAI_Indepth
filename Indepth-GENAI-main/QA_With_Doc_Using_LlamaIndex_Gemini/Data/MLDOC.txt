What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which
focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn,
gradually improving its accuracy.
IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited
for coining the term, “machine learning” with his research (link resides outside ibm.com)
around the game of checkers. Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master,
played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost to the computer.
Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it’s considered a major
milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.
Over the last couple of decades, the technological advances in storage and processing
power have enabled some innovative products based on machine learning, such as
Netflix’s recommendation engine and self-driving cars.
Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science.
Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or
predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects. These insights
subsequently drive decision making within applications and businesses, ideally
impacting key growth metrics. As big data continues to expand and grow, the market
demand for new data scientists will increase. They will be required to help identify the
most relevant business questions and the data to answer them.
Machine learning algorithms are typically created using frameworks such as Python that
accelerate solution development by using platforms like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks
Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth
noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural
networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually
a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.
The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm
learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised
learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The
deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images),
and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different
categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention
required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning
as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides
outside ibm.com).
Classical, or "non-deep," machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to
learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences
between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.
Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers,
containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or
artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the
output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is
activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed
along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just
referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of
more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be
considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that
only has three layers is just a basic neural network.
Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas
such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

What’s the Difference?” for a closer look at how the different concepts relate.

How does machine learning work?
UC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a
machine learning algorithm into three main parts.
A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a
prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or
unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.
An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If
there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess
the accuracy of the model.
A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the
training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the
known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this iterative
“evaluate and optimize” process, updating weights autonomously until a
threshold of accuracy has been met.
Machine learning methods
Machine learning models fall into three primary categories.
Supervised machine learning
Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use
of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.
As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted
appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the
model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a
variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder
from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks,
naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM).
Unsupervised machine learning
Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine
learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters).
These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for
human intervention. This method’s ability to discover similarities and differences in
information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies,
customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the
number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal
component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common
approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural
networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.
Semi-supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and
unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide
classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised
learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised
learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.
For a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out "Supervised
vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference?"
Reinforcement machine learning
Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to
supervised learning, but the algorithm isn’t trained using sample data. This model learns
as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced
to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.
The IBM Watson® system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example.
The system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or
question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to
wager—especially on daily doubles.

Common machine learning algorithms
A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include:
Neural networks: Neural networks simulate the way the human brain works, with
a huge number of linked processing nodes. Neural networks are good at
recognizing patterns and play an important role in applications including natural
language translation, image recognition, speech recognition, and image creation.
Linear regression: This algorithm is used to predict numerical values, based on a
linear relationship between different values. For example, the technique could be
used to predict house prices based on historical data for the area.
Logistic regression: This supervised learning algorithm makes predictions for
categorical response variables, such as “yes/no” answers to questions. It can be
used for applications such as classifying spam and quality control on a
production line.
Clustering: Using unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms can identify
patterns in data so that it can be grouped. Computers can help data scientists by
identifying differences between data items that humans have overlooked.
Decision trees: Decision trees can be used for both predicting numerical values
(regression) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching
sequence of linked decisions that can be represented with a tree diagram. One of
the advantages of decision trees is that they are easy to validate and audit,
unlike the black box of the neural network.
Random forests: In a random forest, the machine learning algorithm predicts a
value or category by combining the results from a number of decision trees.
Advantages and disadvantages of machine learning algorithms
Depending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm
type—supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement—has its own
advantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both
predicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories.
Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented
with a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to
validate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more
unstable than other decision predictors.
Overall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage
for new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in
massive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires
little human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning
system assemble and refine its own algorithms—which will continually improve with
more data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized
experience as the model learns more with every experience with that person.
On the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate
and unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering
sufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on
resources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With
too small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is
completely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers,
organizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the
output.
Real-world machine learning use cases
Here are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day:
Speech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer
speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language
processing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices
incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or
improve accessibility for texting.
Customer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer
journey, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and
social media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about
topics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or
suggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites;
messaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by
virtual assistants and voice assistants.
Computer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful
information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the
appropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has
applications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and
self-driving cars in the automotive industry.
Recommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can
help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling
strategies. Recommendation engines are used by online retailers to make relevant
product recommendations to customers during the checkout process.
Robotic process automation (RPA): Also known as software robotics, RPA uses
intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks.
Automated stock trading: Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven
high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day
without human intervention.
Fraud detection: Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot
suspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about
known fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look
atypical and deserve further investigation.
Challenges of machine learning
As machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier.
However, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of
ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include:
Technological singularity
While this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned
with the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological
singularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick
Bostrum defines superintelligence as “any intellect that vastly outperforms the best
human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom,
and social skills.” Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the
idea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous
systems, like self-driving cars. It’s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never
have an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should
we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to
semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,
but these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI
technology develops.
AI impact on jobs
While a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this
concern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see
that the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the
automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric
vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn’t going away,
but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.
In a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There
will need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people
to address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be
affected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with
artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition
to new roles that are in demand.
Privacy
Privacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data
security. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent
years. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data
of people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more
control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such
as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and
requires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation
such as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally
identifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an
increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and
opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks.
Bias and discrimination
Instances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have
raised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we
safeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be
generated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good
intentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights
some of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their
effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against
job candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap
the project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other
pointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should
be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role.
Bias and discrimination aren’t limited to the human resources function either; they can
be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media
algorithms.
As businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they’ve also become more
active in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its
general purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna
wrote: “IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial
recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling,
violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent
with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.”
Accountability
Since there isn’t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real
enforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for
companies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the
bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration
between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI
models within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide. Some
research (link resides outside ibm.com) shows that the combination of distributed
responsibility and a lack of foresight into potential consequences aren’t conducive to
preventing harm to society.

How to choose the right AI platform for machine learning
Selecting a platform can be a challenging process, as the wrong system can drive up
costs, or limit the use of other valuable tools or technologies. When reviewing multiple
vendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features =
a better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI
platform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to
be delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature
might doom the usefulness of an entire system. Here are some features to consider.
MLOps capabilities. Does the system have:
a unified interface for ease of management?
automated machine learning tools for faster model creation with low-code
and no-code functionality?
decision optimization to streamline the selection and deployment of
optimization models?
visual modeling to combine visual data science with open-source libraries
and notebook-based interfaces on a unified data and AI studio?
automated development for beginners to get started quickly and more
advanced data scientists to experiment?
synthetic data generator as an alternative or supplement to real-world data
when real-world data is not readily available?
Generative AI capabilities. Does the system have:
a content generator that can generate text, images and other content
based on the data it was trained on?
automated classification to read and classify written input, such as
evaluating and sorting customer complaints or reviewing customer
feedback sentiment?
a summary generator that can transform dense text into a high-quality
summary, capture key points from financial reports, and generate meeting
transcriptions?
a data extraction capability to sort through complex details and quickly pull
the necessary information from large documents?
